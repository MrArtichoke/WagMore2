| Wag More v 2.0 - ReadMe |
| ----------------------- |

=== Members: Vincent Della Morte (PO), Katerina Chinnappan, Danny Moon, Gustavo Gomez ===

Wag More is a WEB APPLICATION that I would like to have work on mobile phones as well - that will be the bulk of what we will be doing
in CMPS 115. It works on mobile; however, it doesn't look very good, so we are going to improve it.

Some things I want to add:

1. Mobile layout cleanliness
2. A gift shop and EXP point system
3. An option for everyone that uses the app to add to a story line (this will also get them EXP points)
4. More emojis
5. I am open to more suggestions


OUR MEETING TIMES: Mondays and Wednesdays from 12:30 - 14:30 @ Jack Baskin 316(possibly Fridays as well)

That is all so far. Feel free to email me at vdellamo@ucsc.edu if you need more info.

I will be creating a Slack account soon for our group!
